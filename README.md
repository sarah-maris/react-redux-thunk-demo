# React/Redux/Thunk Demo TEST

This project was created as part of a walk-through to demonstrate how to use Thunk and Redux in a React app.

## Getting started

### Step 1:  Add Foursquare credentials
This app uses the Foursquare API.  To run it you'll need to obtain a ClientID and ClientSecret code from Foursquare.  You can sign up at **[Foursquare Developers](https://foursquare.com/developers/signup)**

Add the credentials to the `credentials-sample.js` file in the `helper` folder and save as `credentials.js`

### Step 2: Install the project framework and start the development server
In the project directory run:

### `yarn install && yarn start`

<br>
or if you prefer to use npm, run:  
### `npm install && npm start`
<br>
This will run the app in  development mode at:  **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
